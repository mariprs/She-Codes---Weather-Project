# She-Codes-Weather-Project

This is a project made with BootStrap for SheCodes International Plus Bootcamp

It uses an API that fetches data from weather reports, so you can currently see the weather in your city!
In the future, it will have even more features as I'll enhance it as I go along with the Bootcamp.
